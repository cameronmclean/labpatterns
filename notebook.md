This is where I jot down all things peculiar to my learning and getting the whole thing set up...

using a mixture of eclipse with PyDev Django and adhoc text editors and terminals

#### Note: mySQL is installed at /Applications/mampstack...blah blah blah
####  and Python 2.7.2 is from anaconda installed at /Users/cameronmclean/anaconda... blah blah blah
### These are not typcial locations and many packages don't find the approprate libraries etc without some wrangling to env variables or PATH settings...

installed mysql-python libraries
`pip install mysql-python`
 needed to add `/Applications/mampstack/mysql/bin/` to `$PATH` to make `mysql_config` executable findable

Set mySQL backend in Django with the following in settings.py

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'mydb',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'bitnami',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

Next - created data schema using MySQLWorkbench
###### Because I have heard it is eaiser to do this then import it via `inspectdb` rather than build the model in Django first...
NOTE:
- foreign key constraints must have a unique name
- used `<tablename><column_name>_fk` syntax to name the constraint so the generated SQL looks something like 

```
-- -----------------------------------------------------
-- Table `mydb`.`force`
-- -----------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mydb`.`force` (
  `force_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `parent_pattern_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `force_pictogram` MEDIUMBLOB NULL,
  `force_description` TEXT NULL,
  INDEX `pattern_name_idx` (`parent_pattern_name` ASC),
  PRIMARY KEY (`force_name`, `parent_pattern_name`),
  CONSTRAINT `force_parent_pattern_fk`
    FOREIGN KEY (`parent_pattern_name`)
    REFERENCES `mydb`.`design_pattern` (`pattern_name`)
    ON DELETE NO ACTION
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION)
ENGINE = InnoDB;
```

e.g the above is for the "force" relation. Note: DELETE/UPDATE are curently set to no action. Will revisit this later....
##### keep the table names in lowercase for import into Django.

#### Django only supports single column primary keys - these are needed for the admin interface - which I want to take advange of...
###### Going back to modify my ER for mySQL now... hmmm

###### 20140422

Modified schema to include single primary keys.
Used MySQLWorkbench to forward engineer basic pattern schema...
Using `mydb` as schema name.
OK!

Now - to autogenerate the models from the db schema, following the Django doc..
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/howto/legacy-databases/

##### Python couldn't find `libmysqlclient.18.dylib`

added the following to ~/.bash_profile

```
# setting env variable for python-mysql to find all the things
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARYPATH:/Applications/mampstack-5.4.26-2/mysql/lib
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Works now.

created models.py from db tables using 

```
$ python manage.py inspectdb > models.py
```

Cleaned up models.py by
1. Setting managed = True
2. Commenting out author model etc for now - just focus on the pattern structure
3. Changed order of model classes to resemnle correct/natural pattern format

synced db with no apps started yet (just an empty project with the models.py not yet moved to an app folder)

```
$ python manage.py syncdb
```

OK

*superuser* for site defined as
##### Username : cameronmclean
##### email : ca.mclean@auckland.ac.nz
##### psw : labpatterns

(for now - just for dev and testing on local machine of course!!)

Started app called **patterns**

```
$ python manage.py startapp patterns
```

moved cleaned up models.py into patterns app folder

added 'patterns' to the installed apps in the project settings.py

```
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'patterns',
)
```

added patterns to the admin.py in the pattern app

```
from patterns.models import *

admin.site.register(DesignPattern)
admin.site.register(Problem)
admin.site.register(Context)
admin.site.register(Solution)
admin.site.register(Force)
admin.site.register(Rationale)
admin.site.register(Diagram)
admin.site.register(Evidence)
```
to make all model objects able to managed by the admin site

## Using an exising mySQL to autogenreate the model wasn't so good

All sorts of niggly little things, like only primary keys can autoupdate, field mismatches 
eg - I had declared pictogram fields as MEDIUMBLOB, but Django doesn't like this - prefers ImageField or FileField, which are stored as VARCHAR and point to the path of the stored image on the webserver 
##### So images for now might not be stored in the db... will chase this up later...

### Re-wrote the models.py from a Django first persective, and overide the default table naming mechanism.
Deleted the database using mySQLWorkbench, created a new one with the same name `mydb`
ran 
`$ python manage.py syncdb`
Needed to issue a new superuser via
`$ python manage.py createsuperuser` (used the same credential as above)

Typical classes for the model (in models.py) now look like this

```
class Force(models.Model):
    id = models.AutoField(primary_key=True)
    name = models.CharField('Name', unique=True, max_length=255)
    parent_pattern = models.ForeignKey(DesignPattern)
    pictogram = models.ImageField('Force Pictogram', upload_to='pictograms')
    description = models.TextField('Description', blank=True)
    
    def __unicode__(self):
        return self.parent_pattern.name

    class Meta:
        db_table = 'force'
```
-Allows autogen on ID field, which the primary key - makes Admin site nicer
- will prbably need to tweak the unicode(self) return later...

In testing - db constraints seem to work - cant add force without it belonging to a parent pattern.
Nice.

I'm liking this for now !

OK - 
### Dealing with changes to DB/Model Schema

So it seems that Django is OK to add new models (i.e classes/db tables), but making chages to exisitng ones and keeping it in sync with the DB is troublesome. i.e if you later want to make a field unique=true

So I installed South and followed their documentation http://south.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/part1.html
`$ pip install South`
Added `'south'` to the installed apps in settings.py
Ran `syncdb`
then ran `$ python manage.py convert_to_south patterns` to convert the exisitng app so that model changes are more eaisily handled and synced with the DB.

Havent needed to use it yet, but internets say it's useful/essential...

###### 20140423

Added example pattern to db via Django admin page.
Admin page and model needs *much* tweaking, but first aim is just to have something there so we can see if R2RML and various engines can get it out and into RDF...
