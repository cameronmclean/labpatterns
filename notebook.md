This is where I jot down all things peculiar to my learning and getting the whole thing set up...

using a mixture of eclipse with PyDev Django and adhoc text editors and terminals

#### Note: mySQL is installed at /Applications/mampstack...blah blah blah
####  and Python 2.7.2 is from anaconda installed at /Users/cameronmclean/anaconda... blah blah blah
### These are not typcial locations and many packages don't find the approprate libraries etc without some wrangling to env variables or PATH settings...

installed mysql-python libraries
`pip install mysql-python`
 needed to add `/Applications/mampstack/mysql/bin/` to `$PATH` to make `mysql_config` executable findable

Set mySQL backend in Django with the following in settings.py

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'mydb',
        'USER': 'root',
        'PASSWORD': 'bitnami',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '3306',
    }
}
```

Next - created data schema using MySQLWorkbench
###### Because I have heard it is eaiser to do this then import it via `inspectdb` rather than build the model in Django first...
	- foreign key constraints must have a unique name
	- used `<tablename><column_name>_fk` syntax to name the constraint so the generated SQL looks something like 
```
-- -----------------------------------------------------
-- Table `mydb`.`force`
-- -----------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `mydb`.`force` (
  `force_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `parent_pattern_name` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  `force_pictogram` MEDIUMBLOB NULL,
  `force_description` TEXT NULL,
  INDEX `pattern_name_idx` (`parent_pattern_name` ASC),
  PRIMARY KEY (`force_name`, `parent_pattern_name`),
  CONSTRAINT `force_parent_pattern_fk`
    FOREIGN KEY (`parent_pattern_name`)
    REFERENCES `mydb`.`design_pattern` (`pattern_name`)
    ON DELETE NO ACTION
    ON UPDATE NO ACTION)
ENGINE = InnoDB;
```
e.g the above is for the "force" relation. Note: DELETE/UPDATE are curently set to no action. Will revisit this later....
Also #### keep the table names in lowercase for import into Django.


### Django only supports single column primary keys - these are needed for the admin interface - which I want to take advange of...
###### Going back to modify my ER for mySQL now... hmmm
